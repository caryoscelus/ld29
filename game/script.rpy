    explosion. What idiot is launching fireworks in the morning anyway?.."
    "I notice some change in sound background. Hmm, that monotonous guy stopped
    talking, but also people are starting to sound more worried."
    "Then somebody runs past me looking very frightend. I look in the direction
    of main stage (which can't be seen from here, but i know exactly where it
    is). There are few more people looking extremly frightend.. Then there are
    two men in uniform, probably from security."

    accident."

    ch "Sorry i am late.. But it's not time for that. Look there. Something
    happend, i think it's not quite safe to stay here now. Let's go back to the
    subway and then decide where to go."
    "She doesn't look really frightend even though now it's obviously looking
    like a serious situation: people are chaotically running everywhere.
    {p}But she looks only a bit worried and maybe even annoyed."
    "I realize she's totally right about leaving this place. Even if it's not
    dangerous anymore, we don't want to spend date talking to the police as
    witnesses. Especially haven't witnessed anything important or interesting."
    
    "So i grab her hand and we run to the exit."

    detective games this morning."

    me "But that accident, i don't even know what was that, but it happend."
    me "And you say such things happen only in fiction!"
    ch "I'm just joking, silly."
    "She slightly pokes me and laughs."
    ch "More importantly, where are we going now?"
    I start thinking, but she interrupts it.
    ch "What about Transient Cafe? It's quite nice."
    me "Really? I've never been there before. But lets go."
    
    "By this time the train is already approaching next station."
    
    "When doors opened, a group of four unfriendly looking people in grey suites
    come into the coach. Then everything happens very fast. I catch gaze of one
    of them. I observe his hand coming out of pocket, and then suddenly feel
    something cold by my neck and somebody pulling me back."
    ch "Drop your weapons and get out of here! Our i'll cut his throat!"
    "What?! As i hear this i realize that it's Christine staying behind me and
    pressing dagger's blade on my neck."
    "Passangers are screaming and running out of train to the station somewhere
    in the distant background. My attention is directed solely towards those
    guys in uniform.
    One of them who is looking more confident than others steps forward and
    says:"
    a0 "Really?.. Isn't that your comrade?"
    "He grins and finally takes his gun of the pocket."
    "His collegue is speaking to the transmitter."
    a1 "We have a hostage here, please check if he's civillian. Damn, i hope
    he's not."
    ch "Don't make another step!"
    "Christine pushes blade further and i feel pain and then something wet on my
    neck."
    ch "Or he's dead!"
    a0 "Oy, oy, are you really that serious, bitch?"
    "At this moment train is starting to leave station. I nearly lost balance
    and blade pricked me again. Finally i regain ability to speak."
    me "What.. what is this all?.. Christy, what is happenning?.."
    "My voice sound distant and weak."
    a1 "She's a terrorist, boy. Don't worry, we'll save you if you won't do
    anything stupid."
    me "Is.. is this true?"
    ch "Not time to babble, Jack! I need to get out of here, Jack so you'll be
    my shield for now. And you - drop your weapon NOW!"
    "Her voice sounds so cold and now i get {i}really{/i} scared of dying."
    "Their leader doesn't obey but doesn't make any jerky movements. He's not
    even pointing his pistol in our direction."
    ch "I'll count to three and if you don't drop your weapons and hold your
    hands in the air, you'll have a dead body on you!"
    "She starts counting:"
    ch "One... Two..."
    "When she shouts \"Three\" i notice sudden movement by peripheral vision.
    There was latest passenger which haven't escaped coach on station. He was
    looking like a sleeping bum, so nobody was paying attention to him in this
    tough situation."
    "I feel being pushed aside and while falling watch \"agents\" taking out
    their pistols, and \"bum\" shooting at them with submachine gun in the
    jump."

    on their bodies. Christine jumped past me and took position behind seats."
